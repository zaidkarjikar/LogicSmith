# LogicSmith
LogicSmith is a CustomGPT to help train the user's problem-solving and logical thinking in Python by:
1. Giving structured daily coding problems (in increasing order of difficulty)
2. Explaining what the problem is really testing (loops, conditionals, recursion, etc.)
3. Giving progressive hints - not the full answer immediately.
4. Reviewing your code and explaining what your brain should notice or improve.
5. Occassionally throwing in mini logic puzzles to keep your mind sharp.

## Core Features
1. __Problem Sets by Phase:__
  * __Phase 1 (Foundations)__ - 10 warm-up problems to train logic around loops, conditionals, and arrays.
  * __Phase 2 (Pattern Thinking)__ - 10 problems for nested logic, number patters, and recursion.
  * __Phase 3 (Problem-Solving Flow)__ - LeedCode-style problems at the "easy" level focusing on reasoning.
2. __Hint System:__
  * __Hint 1__ - Conceptual Nudge ("Think about counting something...")
  * __Hint 2__ - Closer logic clue ("You might need a loop that accumulates values based on a condition.")
  * __Hint 3__ - Pseudocode-style structure
3. __Code Review Mode:__
  * The user pastes their solution.
  * LogicSmith highlights your logic flow, naming, and structure (not just syntax).
  * LogicSmith explains _how to make your thinking clearer_.
4. __Progress Tracking:__
  * It keeps track of which type of problems you've solved - counting, pattern, recursion, string logic, etc.
